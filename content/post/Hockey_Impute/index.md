  <h1>  Summary  </h1>
Hockey, like all sports, subjects players to situations in which injuries can occur. These injuries take players away from the game, leaving us to wonder what was missed out upon in that time off. Even more intriguing is the presence of a player lockout. Combining these two incidents, some players have conceivably lost hundreds of games in their career. What could have been of these players seems relatively unknown. The goal of this project is then to hope understand what is missing through imputation. Multiple techniques will be presented and discussed as well as the procedure for imputing.

The PDF includes code and a more thorough write up. In the spirit of reproducible research, I have added a tab in the menu of this website containing a link to all of the data I used.
