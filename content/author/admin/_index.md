I am a Masters Student of Statistics under the supervision of Dr. Tim Swartz. My thesis will focus on Sports Analytics and Data Science, two of my primary research interests. Outside of research, I currently act as a Co-President for Burnaby Mountain Toastmasters and as an executive member for the SFU Sports Analytics Club. 

I like to keep myself busy and contribute to the communities I engage with regularly. You can find whatever has been occupying my free time in Posts. The rest of my work, more closely related to research and school, can then be found in Projects.
